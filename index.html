        As you may or may not know when one of the  with Covid-19 many people report that they have lost their 
        sense <br>of smell and taste. Many of these people even months after being Covid free have yet to regain their 
        ability <br>to smell and taste. The cause remains a mystery to scientists and while it's being looked into these people
        are left <br>unable to taste their favorite foods or smell their favorite sscents. The funds available for research are
        mostly going <br>into the Covid-19 vaccine and we are left with little to no funds for our smell and taste research. You 
        can help us today <br>by donating any amount as small as 1$ for Covid Taste and Smell Research by clicking the button below.<br>
